# Quick-Care

This is the full-stack application that Iâ€™m developing in my free time. It is made using React + TypeScript, Styled-Components, Material UI, Node.js (Express), MongoDB. 
Current features:
- patient/doctor registration and login with implemented session mechanism and access token refreshment using JWT and Axios,
- account management with possibility of uploading a profile picture,
- ability to make an appointment and cancel it,
- doctors ability to create a clinic and assign it as an office,
- displaying patients and doctors in the table with implemented sorting and filtering mechanism,
- delete account option. 
Forms and validation were made using Formik and Yup, in addition the application has three language versions (English, Polish, German) by using the i18n library. The application state is managed by Redux-Toolkit.
